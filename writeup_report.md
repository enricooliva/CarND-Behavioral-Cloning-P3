### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model is based on NVIDIA End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars, it consists of a normalization layer, 5 convolutional layers and 4 fully connected layers.  (model.py lines 18-24) 
We use strided convolutions in the first three convolutional layers with a 2×2 stride and a 5×5 kernel and a non-strided convolution with a 3×3 kernel size in the last two convolutional layers.

The model includes ELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 81). 

The input image is converted into YUV planes and passed to the network.


#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers and MaxPooling2D layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 88,90,92,97,101). 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting. The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 118).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used the default data from Udacity adding some a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to start using a regression network because is a problem of minimaze the error between steering angle that the network predict and the ground throut steering mesurement.

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model based on NVIDIA End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars I thought this model might be appropriate because the was design for this pourpose.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model adding 2 dropout layers before and after the fully connected layer and and 3 MaxPooling layer between convolutional layer.

Then I filtered the images with a small steering angle and I used the left and right image appling a steering angle correction of +/-0.25. I augmented the set of images adding for each image the flip with a reversed steering angle.

Following  More over in order to reduce the overfitting I insert a perturbation of the steering angle between 0.4 to 1.2. In that way 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. 

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 79-102) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers:

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I used the data provided from Udacity. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would be useful to reduce overfitting. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]


After the collection process, I had 24108x2 number of data points. I then preprocessed this data, crop it, normalize it and by filter the images that has associate a steering angle less than 0.85.

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 5 as evidenced by the training loss was arrived to a constant value. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
